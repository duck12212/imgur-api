The upload API is using the REST standard, and can be found here: http://imgur.com/api/upload/

==Details==

*URL:* http://imgur.com/api/upload/

*Method:* POST (HTTP)

values = [
          ("key", "YOUR_API_KEY"),
          ("image", (c.FORM_FILE, "YOUR_IMAGE_FILE"))]

c.setopt(c.URL, "http://imgur.com/api/upload/")
