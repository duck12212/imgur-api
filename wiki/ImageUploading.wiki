=Image Uploading=

The upload API is using the REST standard, and can be found here: http://imgur.com/api/upload/

==Details==

*URL:* http://imgur.com/api/upload/

*Method:* POST (HTTP)

==Parameters=
_Must be sent using POST._
  * 'image' - Must be your binary image file, not the text inside the image.
  * 'key'   - Your registered developer API key. Click [http://imgur.com/register/api.php here] to register for a key.

==Implementation==
Use [http://curl.haxx.se/ cURL] to send the POST data to Imgur. cURL libraries are available for most languages and are very simple to use.

==Limitations==
The upload API has a daily and hourly upload limit for any given IP address. A single IP address is able to upload 50 images an hour and 200 images a day. For a possible lift or extension of this limit, please contact alan at: alan@imgur.com.
